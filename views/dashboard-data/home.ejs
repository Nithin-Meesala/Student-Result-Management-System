    <p>
      The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) Bangalore,
      established in November 1987, was initially known as the Centre for
      Development of Advanced Computing Technology (C-DACT). It originated as a
      response to India's pursuit of supercomputing technology after being
      denied the purchase of a Cray supercomputer by the US Government due to
      nuclear weapons concerns. Dr. Vijay Bhatkar was appointed as the director
      of C-DACT, with an initial funding of â‚¹30,00,00,000, equivalent to the
      cost of a Cray supercomputer. A prototype computer benchmarked at the 1990
      Zurich Super-computing Show showcased India's achievement of having the
      world's second most powerful publicly demonstrated supercomputer. The
      result of the initiative was the creation of PARAM 8000, a significant
      supercomputer released in 1991.
